## Running Gulp
Just to clarify - it is **not required** to run gulp for the meetup. It's only being used to compile the styles. However if you'd like to play around on your own time, follow the steps below to get setup.

#### 1. Install Dependencies
First, ensure you have `Node.JS` installed. Download that [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

In a terminal window, enter `cd path/to/filename` (change path to match wherever your emoji-finder folder is located).

Enter `npm install`. This will automatically install all dependencies for the project :)

#### 2. Actually Running Gulp
After you've done the above, and `npm install` has stopped doing it's magic, enter `gulp default`. Now whenever you update a `scss` file gulp will automatically recompile to `css`. To end the session, press ctrl+c on your keyboard.
